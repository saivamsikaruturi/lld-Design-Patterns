Requirements

Notification Service should be decoupled from the main application.
Service should support multiple types of notifications like Text message or QR code.
Service should support multiple ways of sending notifications like text, e-mail, WhatsApp message.
Each type can have its own processor.
Processors should not be tightly coupled as in the future we may need to support additional ways like Telegram message.
