Payment Processing System
Imagine you're designing a payment system that:

Supports different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, Net Banking).
Works with multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay).
These two hierarchies vary independently:

Payment Methods: New payment methods like UPI or Wallets might be introduced in the future.
Payment Gateways: New gateways might also be added or switched.
